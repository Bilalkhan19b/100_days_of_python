# 100_days_of_python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge repository! This is where I document my journey through 100 days of intensive Python programming, learning, and project building.

## About the Challenge

The '100 Days of Python' challenge is an initiative I embarked upon to enhance my Python programming skills, build practical projects, and dive deep into the world of Python. The challenge involves daily coding, reading documentation, and hands-on practice with Python.

## Progress

- **Days 1-30:** Focused on mastering Python's fundamentals, including data types, variables, and basic control structures.
- **Days 31-60:** Explored advanced topics like object-oriented programming, error handling, and Python libraries.
- **Days 61-100:** Dived into project-based learning, where I applied my skills to create real-world applications and solutions.
